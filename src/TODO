* Mime.types - can this go in the JAR
* Remove use of BufferedReader
* More tests for Content-Length (return this for directory resource)
* Possibly split ByteRange out into FixedByteRange and ByteRange.
* Naming of Range, RangeSpecifier, FixedRangeSpecifier, ByterRange and Suffix
* Batching of read requests on InputStream--possibly in 1K batches
* PartialFileResource needs a ResponseContentPart(Content-type, Content-range, content)
* So maybe instead of dumpResource, have a ResponseContent:
    HeaderResponseContent
    BinaryResponseContent
    HtmlResponseContent
    ResponseContentPart.
* Need to decide if headers get special treatment. Rather than a tree of resources, it could just be a
  a list--lots of headers followed by content.
  That's hard to say without having done all the other headers. They don't necessarily belong to the Resource.
