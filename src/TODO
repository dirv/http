* OPTIONS needs to be more tailored depending on whether or not the file exists, and its access right.s
* The Response model needs work. Currently is always adds a Content-Type and a Content-Length header, and then Content
  can add its own additional header, which is really only used for ranges.
   => Might be better to have a Response object which can take headers, and then a subtype of this called ContentResponse. 
* HEAD support
* Test for StreamContent and FixedRange stuff
* Add an Allow header for 405 method options
* Test for Deleting content
* Return Last-Modified header
* HtmlHeadedContent should have text/html content-type for all its children when a range is applied to it. (Possibly same for headed content in general)
* Cache should have a max size (possibly use a linked list where recently accessed items are put back to the start)
* shasum & my hash comparison function
* ResponseCode 200 should be returning contnet.
* ErrorResponse renamed to somethign else.

* Directory listings for directories with no files
* Html for directory listings
* File sizes for directory entries
* Redirects - currently requires full URL
* Redirect - redirect code
* Mime.types - can this go in the JAR
* More tests for Content-Length (return this for directory resource)

Things to do to make this a REAL server:
* Saving request logs to disk
* Internal server error logged to disk
